Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Written Analysis of VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of the analysis from this module is to create the technical analysis of outcomes based on the launch date and another outcome-basedÂ on goals, from the 2 outcomes, it is important to draw conclusions on what difference will it makes for the data when they are analyzed based on different variables. Another purpose of the analysis is to identify the limitations of the analysis as well as the datasets.

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was performed through chart/graphical images of the subcategory "plays" filtered by its success, failure, or canceled nature. The analysis of "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" resulted in a line graph that includes the listed month and number of outcomes based on success, failure, or canceled nature. Whereas, in comparison, the "Outcomes Based on Goals" gave a more technical analysis of the same figures, however, it is based on the percentage ratio of success, failure, and canceled to the number of total projects. Both analyses were based differently, one based on launch date and the other based on goals, this shows that analysts can obtain data from specific requests. One challenge with the analysis of outcomes based on goals were the various formulas for the range of the goals. 

## Results
One conclusion that could be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that the success of the outcomes remains higher than its failure or cancellation. Another conclusion based on the graph is there were not canceled outcomes during the month of October. The conclusion for Outcomes-based on Goals could be drawn is that the outcome between success and failure are inverse as the goal increases. Line graphs are best to portray the relationships between these specific data set, one possible table/graph would be a bar graph, however, column/bar graphs are more rigid when compared to those of line graphs.
